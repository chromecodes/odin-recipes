        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> This dish is a total flavour bomb, filled with a rich broth, tender meat, and noodles, topped with a 7-minute egg – my new favourite thing in the world. My family went nuts for this; it's complex, easy, and satisfying. You don't have to make the egg, but I think it's so worth it. </p>

        <h3> Preparing Steps </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and sriracha sauce; stir to combine. Add chicken broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes. Add chicken and bok choy; simmer gently until bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes. </li>
            <li> Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add ramen noodles and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and drizzle with vegetable oil to prevent sticking. </li>
            <li> While ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes. </li>
            <li> Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer soft boiled eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; let sit about 3 minutes. Drain eggs, carefully peel away shells, and slice in half. </li>
            <li> Divide ramen between 4 bowls. Add broth. Top each with jalapeno, green onions, cilantro, and soft-boiled egg. Serve immediately. </li>
        </ol>
