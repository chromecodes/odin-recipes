        <h3> Preparing Steps </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Start by preparing your ingredients. Rehydrate the dried wakame with water in a bowl, chop up the tofu into small 1cm cubes. </li>
            <li> Boil about 1L of water mixed with the sachet of dashi stock in a saucepan. </li>
            <li> In the meantime, pour a small amount of the water into a smaller pan and stir in 2 tablespoons of miso paste (this is to avoid making a lumpy soup). </li>
            <li> Remove the rehydrated wakame from the water, add the wakame seaweed and tofu directly to the stock. </li>
            <li> Add the dissolved miso paste to the stock and stir to keep the mixture smooth, turn off the heat. Do not allow the soup to boil, this helps retain the miso’s flavour. </li>
            <li> Serve into small bowls and add the sliced spring onion to the bowls. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4> Tips and Information </h4>
        <p> Add grilled fish, mochi, shellfish, fried tofu, shiitake mushrooms, nameko mushrooms, shredded daikon radish, ready-made miso soup toppings and other ingredients to your soup for variety. The combinations with miso soup are endless.</p>
